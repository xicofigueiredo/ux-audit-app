## üöÄ PHASE 1: Executive Summary Bar & Issue IDs

### Database & Backend Setup

- [ ] **Create migration for enhanced data tracking**
  ```bash
  rails generate migration AddIssueIdsAndJiraIntegration issue_id_counter:integer jira_epic_key:string share_token:string shared_at:datetime
  ```

- [ ] **Add VideoAudit model enhancements**
  - [ ] Add `issue_id_counter` default: 0
  - [ ] Add indexes for `share_token` (unique) and `jira_epic_key`
  - [ ] Add method `generate_issue_ids` to assign UXW-001, UXW-002, etc.

    - [ ] `total_issues` count
    - [ ] `high_count`, `medium_count`, `low_count`
    - [ ] `affected_steps` (unique issue titles)
    - [ ] `estimated_effort` (T-shirt sizing: XS/S/M/L/XL)
    - [ ] `top_issues` (first 5 by severity)

- [ ] **Create VideoAuditsHelper methods**
  ```ruby
  # In app/helpers/video_audits_helper.rb
  def severity_icon(severity)       # üî¥üü°üîµ for High/Med/Low
  def extract_component(issue)      # Navigation, Form, Button, etc.
  def estimate_frequency(issue)     # Often/Sometimes/Rarely
  def estimate_confidence(issue)    # High/Medium/Low
